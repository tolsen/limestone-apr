RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:



CURRENT VOTES:


CURRENT test/testall -v EXCEPTIONS:

    Please add any platform anomilies to the following exception list.

    * 'testipsub' will tickle an Solaris 8 getaddrinfo() IPv6 bug,
      causing the test to hang.  Configure with --disable-ipv6 if
      using an unpatched Solaris 8 installation.

    * The 'testdso' tests will not work if configured with
      --disable-shared since the loadable modules cannot be built.

    * 'testdso' fails on older versions of OpenBSD due to dlsym(NULL,
      ...) segfaulting.

    * Win32 Not Implemented tests 
        poll: pollcb not implemented
        procmutex: lacks fork() support
        sock : Sync behavior causes us to skip one test
        sockets: tcp6_socket/udp6_socket skipped for no IPv6 adapter
        sockopt: TCP isn't corkable
        users: username: Groups from apr_uid_get not implemented

    * Win32 tests are known to fail when APR_HAVE_IPV6, but there is no
      ipv6 adapter is loaded (even loopback is sufficient).  There are
      obnoxious getaddrinfo() missing results from looking up a fixed
      IPv4-IPv6 mixed notation address, which reflect a Win32 bug.
        ipsub: One test fails for IPv6 with no IPv6 adapter configured
        sock : One test fails for IPv6 with no IPv6 adapter configured


SEE svn.apache.org:/repos/asf/apr/apr/trunk/STATUS for all other open
issues to be addressed.  [First, patched in trunk; then considered for
backport to the stable branch.]
